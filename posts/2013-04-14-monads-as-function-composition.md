I found this clip on youtube and quite like it. 
In this video Mr. Beckman stresses the significance of function composition and 
explains how function composition is a monoid. He gives a nice example of 
monoid, clock-arithmetic. Most importantly, he shows the beautiful link between
function composition and monads.
