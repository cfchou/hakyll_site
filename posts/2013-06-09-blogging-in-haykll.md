title: Blogging in Hakyll
tags: hakyll, haskell

I recently switched to [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html) as my 
new blog system. IMHO, it's not the most hassle-free way of blogging. That 
said, it has a couple of merits that are close to my heart:

1. It's a medium size project, which makes it a good one to hack on. 
2. It works on top of many great projects like, Pandoc, Blaze, Snap, etc..
3. Monoids/Applicatives/Functors/Monads are incorporated in its design(`ack
   --type=haskell instance .`). I can learn those functional programming design 
   patterns while training my eyes for some a little quirky code.
4. I can write haskell to add more functionalities.

Currently, there are a few things I'd like to add: tags, syntax
highlighting and CSS in [Clay](http://fvisser.nl/clay/).
